# HttpUrlPractice

Here is a project that Parses JSON data into readable and managable Java. 

The uniform resource location that I used is: http://services.hanselandpetal.com/feeds/flowers.json

It's also iportant to note that I am not using apache HttpClient, I am using the updated HttpUrlConnection class.
